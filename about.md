My aim is to accelerate the transformation of international organizations, through the adoption of emerging technologies. I enjoy to articulate the big picture (as a computing architect) with practical feasibility (as a software developer and system engineer). Current focus is on agile multi-functional squads that have to deliver programmable digital infrastructure.

### Areas of Interest

- systems of engagement (chat bots, AWS SysOps Administrator, digital communications)
- software development (CI, git, python, java, c, javascript, AWS Developer)
- infrastructure as code (AWS Solution Architect, cloud-init, libcloud)
- security of information systems (CISSP, PKI)
- innovation as way of life (Scrum Master, product management, communities of practice)
